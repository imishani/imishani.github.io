I am a PhD Student at <a href='https://www.ri.cmu.edu'>The Robotics Institute</a>, Carnegie Mellon University, advised by <a href='https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maxim/'>Maxim Likhachev</a>.
My research is driven by a profound interest in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.

More specifically, I am interested in developing algorithms for robotic manipulation, particularly in cluttered environments where heavy contact is essential.
Additionally, I am passionate about exploring the integration of recent advancements in deep learning with the robustness of search-based planning algorithms to enhance motion planning techniques in high-dimensional spaces.

Previously, I was a Master's Student at <a href='https://english.tau.ac.il/'>Tel Aviv University</a>, advised by <a href='http://web2.eng.tau.ac.il/wtest/Avishailab/index.php/sintov/'>Avishai Sintov</a> at <a href='http://web2.eng.tau.ac.il/wtest/Avishailab/'>TAU Robotics Lab</a>.
